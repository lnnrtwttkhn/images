    Each circle represents a commit. Commits on the `Main` branch are shown in gray. The branch `Feature A` (blue circles) was created from the `Main` branch and later merged again. In-between, another branch `Feature A-1` was created from the `Feature A` branch (green circles) and merged with that branch again before the `Feature A` branch was eventually merged with the `Main` branch. The branch `Feature B` was created but abandoned and not merged with the `Main` branch.
